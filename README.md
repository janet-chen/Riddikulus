# About:
**Confronted by his worst fear, a spider, Ron Weasley casted “Riddikulus!” to transform it into something less fearsome.**    

**“Riddikulus” is the project our team developed during Lumohacks 2017.** Lumohacks is an annual 24-hour hackathon to tackle health issues with technology. Our team is composed of four Computer Science student students from University of British Columbia (UBC), Daphne Liu, Janet Chen, Michael Goh, and Li Ze Choo. As most of us had background in Virtual Reality (VR), we were curious to see how the topic of this year, mental health, and VR can intersect. We received First Place amongst a total of 60 teams and won CAD $6130 worth of prizes.

# Inspiration: 
We began searching for project ideas online, and came across the use of VR “exposure therapy” in military to relieve soldiers from post-traumatic stress. **Exposure therapy is a widely-used technique to expose patients to their feared object or context in a safe, controlled environment.** We also learned that phobia is a mental health issue that is often overlooked. Its impact on people suffering from it can range from altering the lifestyle to avoid phobias, fainting and panic attacks. 

# The Project:
At Lumohacks 2017, we created “Riddikulus”, a VR experience to help patients overcome their phobia with exposure therapy.  We developed visual and auditory simulations of the three most common fears: **spiders, snakes and heights.** The app is intended for children from 12-17 years old and is to be used jointly with parents and therapists. **It is built with Unity, C#, Google VR SDK, and Google Cardboard.**
**Our team is proud to deliver a complete, intuitive and interactive prototype.** This project both reflects upon our passion for VR and our drive to learn under time constraints.  We gained technical skills such as linking multiple scenes and animating objects in Unity. Five minutes before the deadline, the project could not build due to a bug. We troubleshooted and narrowed down to the lack of link between Google Cardboard and the camera.

# Future Work: 
We certainly hope to expand on the project in the future. Our ideas include pairing the Google Cardboard with additional hardware such as Muse and Fitbit. This allows quantitative tracking of patients’ physical response, such as brain waves and heart rate. The other idea involves collaboration with psychologists and researchers on the topic of phobia therapy. We will be meeting with experts shortly to explore areas of research or social venture.
